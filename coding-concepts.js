// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding conceptual questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

var cohort = "Echo 2021"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: it will tell the lenght of the string "Echo 2021" the output should be 9
// b) Verify and explain: the answer was 9, strings have a length property and each character in the string can be accounted for by its placement called an index. The counting of the characters start at 0 and moves forward.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

var greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[3])

// a) Your answer: the number 3 indicate the index of the string the output should be l
// b) Verify and explain: the ouput was l [3] indicate a single character from the string by its index


// --------------------3) What will this log?

var languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
var index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: if index =1 then the output should be "Ruby"
// b) Verify and explain: the output was 1 because the index = 1 refer to the position of the index in the array which is "Ruby"


// --------------------4) What will this log?

var weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: it should upcase all the letters in the arrays
// b) Verify and explain: I ran the code but it wasn't working on my terminal


// --------------------5) What will this log?

var dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: it should indicate the type of unevaluated "value" the output should be what type of data is in the arrays
// b) Verify and explain: the ouput was "number" I can't understand why in this case the ouput should have been "string"?
